What's GDS and TDS?
<br></br>
<br></br>
GDS and TDS stand for gross debt and total debt service ratios. They are percentages of income that cover your:
<br></br>
<br></br>
GDS: Housing costs
<br></br>
<br></br>
TDS: Housing costs and any other debts
<br></br>
<br></br>
Formulas for GDS/TDS
<br></br>
<br></br>
Gross debt service ratio is calculated by the sum of your housing costs, mortgage payments, property taxes, heating and condo fees divided by your annual income.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Total debt service ratio is calculated by the the gross debt above (housing, mortgage, property, etc.) + debt and loan payments divided by annual income.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Why are they important?
<br></br>
<br></br>
It let's you and lenders know how much you're able to borrow to purchase a home. Generally speaking, if you go over the limits below (39% and 44%) you should either save for a larger down payment, or pay off more of your outstanding debts. Your GDS and TDS are also used when granting a mortgage pre-approval.
<br></br>
<br></br>
What's a good GDS and TDS ratio?
<br></br>
<br></br>
Ideally your GDS and TDS should be below 35% and 42% respectively.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Given that Domus works with 30+ lender partners, we're able to support up to 45% and 47% for GDS and TDS ratios, and up to 50% for both under certain conditions e.g. a downpayment of 35%.
