    <h2>Home Equity Line of Credit</h2>
    </div>
    <br></br>
<br></br>
    A home equity line of credit is a revolving loan that uses your home as collateral. Also known as a HELOC, it can be coupled with a mortgage or used for financing another home. It is similar to a credit card; HELOCs need to have its minimum payments amounts paid monthly.
    <br></br>
<br></br>
New homeowners with a mortgage are usually offered a HELOC if they have enough down-payment for equity in their home. You can either get it at a bank or other financial institutions.
<br></br>
<br></br>
People get a HELOC for similar reasons why people get a cash-out refinance: weddings, car payments, investments, tuition, home renovations, medical expenses, TFSA/RRSP contributions, etc.
<br></br>
<br></br>
The great thing about a home equity LOC is that it's there when you need it.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Advantages
<br></br>
<br></br>
The main advantage is the flexibility:
<br></br>
<br></br>
Unlike a refinance, you don't need to break your existing mortgage to get one and therefore possibly pay a mortgage penalty.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Flexible access to cash.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Disadvantages
<br></br>
<br></br>
The main disadvantages are the fees and high requirements:
<br></br>
<br></br>
Affected by the prime rate: your monthly payments will likely increase if the prime rate goes up.
<br></br>
High qualification requirements.
<br></br>
Additional fees.
<br></br>
Penalties for missing payments.
<br></br>
Because the amount of HELOC available is calculated from your home's value, you need to pay for home appraisal fees. Other fees may include: title search and insurance fees, and legal fees.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Refinance vs. HELOC
<br></br>
<br></br>
As mentioned above, people often get a cash-out refinance or home equity line of credit for similar reasons. HELOCs are used as you need it, whereas the money taken out of a refinance is used right away. You can learn more about refinancing here.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Cash out refinance:
<br></br>
<br></br>
Breaking current mortgage for a new one.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Interest on the entire amount starts immediately.
<br></br>
<br></br>
The interest rate is generally lower but may incur penalty fees for breaking the mortgage.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Home equity line of credit:
<br></br>
<br></br>
Generally at a higher interest because of the prime rate.
<br></br>
Pull out money as you go.
<br></br>
The mortgage isn't broken for a new one i.e. no penalty fees.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Requirements
<br></br>
<br></br>
Like other loans, a HELOC will require good credit, stable income and a reasonable amount of debt relative to that income:
<br></br>
<br></br>
Own at least 20% equity in your home.
Good credit: generally 650 minimum but 740+ for often the best rates.
Proof of income: T4, pay stubs, etc.
Relatively good income to debt ratios
<br></br>
<br></br>
Don't meet the requirements for a HELOC? You might be able to qualify for a second mortgage.
<br></br>

Home equity line of credit calculator
<br></br>
<br></br>
To calculate how much you qualify for with a HELOC: take the maximum LTV (loan to value), which is 80% of the the home value and subtract the remaining mortgage balance. It's important to check that the HELOC amount does not exceed 65% of the home's value.
<br></br>
<br></br>
For example, if the home is appraised at $350,000, the max LTV amount would be $350,000 x 80% = $280,000. Subtract the remaining mortgage balance: $280,000 - $175,000 = $105,000 to get the eligible HELOC amount. Now divide that by the home's value: $105,000 / $350,000 = 30%. Since the amount does not exceed 65% of the home's value, we're good!
