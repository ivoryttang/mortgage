    <h2>Why Domus?</h2>
    Domus isn't your traditional mortgage broker or lender.
    </div>
    <br></br>
<br></br>
    At Domus, we use intelligent software to replace both the repetitive work of the loan agent and loan processor and make the process fully online. From beginning to close, we have all of the following accessible from your online portal:
    <br></br>
<br></br>
1.  We provide a place to easily input your data and upload documents to assemble a loan application. We will help auto-fill most of these fields once being granted access to your accounts. 
<br></br>
<br></br>
2.  Run credit reports 
<br></br>
<br></br>
Obtain Required Documents: Collect necessary documents from the loan applicant, including identification, Social Security number, and consent to run a credit check 
Choose a Credit Reporting Agency: Select a credit reporting agency to pull the credit report. Common agencies include Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion 
Access the Credit Reporting System: Utilize the chosen agency's online portal or contact them via phone to initiate the credit report request
Provide Applicant Information: Input the applicant's details, such as name, address, Social Security number, and any other required information, into the credit reporting system 
Request the Credit Report: Submit the request to generate the applicant's credit report from the credit reporting agency 
Review the Credit Report: Once generated, review the credit report to assess the applicant's credit history, score, and any red flags that may impact the loan decision 
Use the Information: Use the credit report findings to evaluate the applicant's creditworthiness and determine loan terms and conditions
<br></br>
<br></br>
3.  Shop for the best rate based on the given information.	
Analyzing the rate sheets that change multiple times a day is just one part of our secret sauce.
<br></br>
<br></br>
4.  If the consumer agrees on the rate, lock the rate then
<br></br>
<br></br>
5.  Submit the loan application to the lender.
<br></br>
<br></br>
6.  For each of the following conditions coming back from the lender, they need to properly take care of it. Common conditions are:
<br></br>
<br></br>
      a. Ask for updated documents like paycheck, proof of employment, tax return, w-2
      <br></br>
      b. Explanation letter for some item on the bank statement, like cash deposit, large deposit etc.
      <br></br>
      c. Explanation letter for some items on credit report, like recent inquiries, some balance, etc.
      <br></br>
      d. Explanation of the source of down-payment, especially if gifted from parents/relatives, in some cases the lender may not accept.
      <br></br>
<br></br>
     Each of those conditions needs to be taken care of promptly. Often, after you submit those conditions to the lender, they may not be satisfied and ask for more explanation,  or even come up with some new conditions after further review.
     <br></br>
<br></br>
7.  After the loan is approved, it will go to the funding department of the lender.  Again, they may come up some funding conditions, typical ones are:  
       a. latest loan statement (in the case of refinance) / pay off letter from current lender in order to calculate how much to close.
       b.  Explain any last minute new items on the bank statement /credit report. 
       c. those condition sometimes works with escrow/title company
       d.  Consumer pay whatever balance to escrow,  lender fund loan amount to escrow,  escrow pay current amount of old lender in case refinance.
<br></br>
<br></br>
8. After all funding conditions are closed,  the loan is funded,  all jobs are done.  The title/escrow will be recorded in the county the same day or next business day. 
<br></br>
<br></br>
9. Escrow will ask for commission payment information,  and will mail a check for the commission in the next few days.
